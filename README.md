To run the project:

  1. Clone the project
  2. Install dependencies by running: `npm install`
  3. Compile *index.ts* by running: `npx tsc index.ts`
  4. Run `node index --help` for a list of available commands

Note: This is a test project to evaluate problem-solving skills. For a real world project, a bundler like webpack would be ideal to combine all js files into a single one.
